# The way to prove that it works.
- Basically, the way that we can prove the functional requirement that we implemented is to run the code, and introduce the ingredients, the amount, and the units and store them in 3 lists using the methods we have on our code. This is with the purpose of having the ingredient information that later we are going to use to filter the recipes in our cookbook and show the user the recipes that are prepared using those ingredients depending the amount available and also the units of that amount like grams, kilograms, etc.
- Our second requirement is to read the .json file with our recipes, we store the info in a variable and then all the info in a list that we are going to use to compare the ingredient that the user enters with the list of all the recipes(Our cookbook) and then filter them.
